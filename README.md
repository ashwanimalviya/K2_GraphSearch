# K2_GraphSearch

Project for Aero E 504: Decision Making under Uncertainty. Course taught by Professor Peng Wei.
This project implements the K2 Algorithm inspired by Cooper's Algorithm proposed in 1992. This code was also inspired by the Mathworks implementation written by Guangdi Li.

Included are the 3 datasets that the K2 Alogorithm had to run on.
* titanic.csv - least number of variables
* whitewine.csv - medium number of varibles
* schoolgrades.csv - largest number of variables

K2 algorithm was able to find a graph structure that fit the data well. In the julia notebook, I include the number of trials that it took to obtain the graph structure.
